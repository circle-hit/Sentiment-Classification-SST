4 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force .
3 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done .
3 there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
1 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
4 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .
0 final verdict : you 've seen it all before .
1 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
1 you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
4 a slick , engrossing melodrama .
1 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
